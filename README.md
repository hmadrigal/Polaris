# Polaris
Polaris was (or is) a framework that was created to facilitate WPF (XAML) development. 
It has been a while since any of the member has worked on XAML based projects, and the project is not anymore being maintened. 
However, I've decided to keep the code as a reference for me and other who may find portions of this handy for their tasks.
